squid project with UCLA
================

NOTES:

2025 April 7: 

Want a specific summary table (like in excel) that groups by cruise/haul. 

compare years as a before and after of a climatic event, see selection from that event

summarize at a whole genome level variation between years - fst comparisons between years

get as much metadata as possible as far as dates - ask him to CC me on the email

Ancestry adjusted LD pruning ready to go, maybe run for squid by cohort

2025 April 15:
organize samples by cruise/haul and try to extrapolate date based on that
 - first two numbers of cruise is year, second two are the number of cruise in the year, and the last one tells which ship
 
put a map together to extrapolate the locations

SQ0001-4 are from monterey 

2025 April 16:
first grouping by year and then by lat to test for a gradient

spread across PC1 shows a gradient of ancestry that could be artifactual or based on year/lat

2025 April 23: 
check in on thinning, if 100 to 1
send pdf of both PCAs without extra labeling, and pdfs of ngsadmix results
- get basic stuff done, then if money from paul comes in we can do more of a deep dive

2025 May 2:
will be doing regular stuff like what was done for the two separate runs, just together
 - want nucleotide diversity stats
 - organize admix results by lat with bins for socal, cencal, norcal?, oregon, and alaska
 - report due by June 15, will be providing figures and some methods
