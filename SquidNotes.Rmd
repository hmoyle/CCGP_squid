2025 April 7: 

Want a specific summary table (like in excel) that groups by cruise/haul. 

compare years as a before and after of a climatic event, see selection from that event

summarize at a whole genome level variation between years - fst comparisons between years

get as much metadata as possible as far as dates - ask him to CC me on the email

Ancestry adjusted LD pruning ready to go, maybe run for squid by cohort

2025 April 15:
organize samples by cruise/haul and try to extrapolate date based on that
 - first two numbers of cruise is year, second two are the number of cruise in the year, and the last one tells which ship
 
put a map together to extrapolate the locations

SQ0001-4 are from monterey 

2025 April 16:
first grouping by year and then by lat to test for a gradient

spread across PC1 shows a gradient of ancestry that could be artifactual or based on year/lat
